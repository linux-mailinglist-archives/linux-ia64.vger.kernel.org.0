Our Kconfig has:

  config GENERIC_LOCKBREAK
  	bool
  	default y
  	depends on SMP && PREEMPTION

And we have exactly one defconfig that enables both SMP and PREEMPT,
arch/powerpc/configs/85xx/ge_imp3a_defconfig, which is some ~10 year old
PCI card embedded thing I've never heard of. High chance anyone who has
those is not running upstream kernels on them.

So I think we'd be happy for you rip GENERIC_LOCKBREAK out, it's almost
entirely unused on powerpc anyway.

cheers
