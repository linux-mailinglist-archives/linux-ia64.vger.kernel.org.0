Dear =


This proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is from someone you =
do not know or had meant before, I had to contact you believing that you ar=
e a reputable person and as such, you cannot abscond with my share of the m=
oney at the conclusion of this transaction.

I am Mr. Mmedin Williams, the director, and coordinator of the Finance and =
Contract Department of the Minerals and Energy with the South African Gover=
nment. The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of t=
he DME deliberately over-inflated the contract values of the various contra=
ct awarded. In the course of disbursement of the original contract value, m=
y office was able to track down the sum of (US$20.5 Million) Twenty Million=
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars as the over-invoiced sum. This=
 money is now floating in the DME domiciliary account with the South Africa=
n Reserve Bank (SARB).

I and my colleague now want to quickly transfer this fund to a safe nominat=
ed foreign bank account for investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matt=
er of government policy to operate any foreign account because of our statu=
s as civil/public servants. Hence the need to solicit for a partner abroad =
to enable us to transfer this money into your foreign bank account. Upon yo=
ur acceptance of this proposal, we have also agreed on a sharing ratio of.

Upon your follow up response, then we can proceed with next step.

Regards,

Mr. Mmedin Williams
42 Homestead Road, Rivonia, Sandton
Johannesburg South Africa.
