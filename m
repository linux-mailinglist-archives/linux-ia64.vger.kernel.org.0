Hmm, I simply used this on my system to make pud_clear_tests() work, not
sure if it works on all archs:

pud_val(*pudp) |= RANDOM_NZVALUE;

It can be added later, no problem. I did not expect this to work flawlessly
on s390 right from the start anyway, with all our peculiarities, so don't
let this hinder you. I might come up with an add-on patch later.

Actually, using get_unmapped_area() as suggested by Kirill could also
solve this issue. We do create a new mm with 3-level page tables on s390,
and the dynamic upgrade to 4 or 5 levels is then triggered exactly by
arch_get_unmapped_area(), depending on the addr. But I currently don't
see how / where arch_get_unmapped_area() is set up for such a dummy mm
created by mm_alloc().
